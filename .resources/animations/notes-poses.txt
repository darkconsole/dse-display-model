exporting poses:

* export the animation to xml tagfile.
* use 1-build.bat.
* use 2-install.bat or copy from hkx to mod.
* configure fnis.

custom collision shapes for usable furniture:

* copy a working bhk collision object from a working mesh into the final mesh you want to have collision.
* make basic shape in max
* export as oldrim nif named shape.nif
* overwrite shape.nif in chunkmerge
* chunkmerge:
	- nif-file output.nif (which started as a nif with no shapes)
	- collision-file shape.nif
	- template template-clutter.nif
	- mesh data
	- copy the bhkMoppBvTreeShape into final sse nif's bhkCollisionObject
	- make sure the chunks layers are clutter
* run the reorder nodes command in nifskope on final nif.
