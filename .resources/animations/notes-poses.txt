exporting poses:

	* export the animation to xml tagfile.
	* use 1-build.bat.
	* use 2-install.bat or copy from hkx to mod.
	* configure fnis.

custom collision shapes for usable furniture:

	* copy a working bhk collision tree from a working mesh into the final mesh you want to have collision.
		- the BSXFlags
		- the bhkCollisionObject
		- Spells > Sanitize > Reorder Blocks
	* make basic shape in max
	* export as oldrim nif overwrite shape.nif in chunkmerge
	* chunkmerge:
		- nif-file overwrite output.nif 
		- collision-file shape.nif
		- template template-clutter.nif
		- mesh data
		- copy the bhkMoppBvTreeShape into final sse nif's bhkCollisionObject->bhkRigidBody
		- delete old collision shape that may have been unseated by copying in new shape
		- make sure the chunk material's material is whatever it should be, and that layer is clutter.
	* run the reorder nodes command in nifskope on final nif.
